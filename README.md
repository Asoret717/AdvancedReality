Virtual reality project with nodejs and unity.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81707462/141654892-327c44ef-7191-4d8a-b430-6216b25f9c03.png)

## Description:

In the future I have to make a virtual reality tour about Galdar's technologyc park, so I made this as a practise. This is for
the company ITC(Instituto tecnol√≥gico de canarias), and the interesting part its adding to the apps they make a crud with sql.

So the app will be a webpage which lets you watch some photos and 360 spaces of Lanzarote, with users that can register, login, make
comments, and send messages to the staff. With other pleasant extras like the dark mode and user configuration. I have no idea about
unity at the start of this project but the idea is learning to be ready for the next one.

## Database models:

The first table is used for the login and register, of the users, also for the admins with the attribute "isAdmin", because the admin
and the users can do things than the guests that doesn't log in. The user writes texts and reviews, so they are related, in the texts
we save the user email apart from the id to know where to answer if needed, and in the reviews we save the username to show it in the
reviews view, so other users can see it. Finally everyone can watch the images, they have an attribute called place to represent in which
360 image they are allowed to be seen.

I will make it with XAMPP MySql.

### E/R Model:

## User requirements:

R1. Platform

    R1.1. The app will be a web page
  
R2. Is going to be mostly what they do normally, but adding sql management

R3. The users don't need to log in or register to access the app, but they will have less options

R4. The app has a main menu, from there you can access to some options and one to go to the virtual reality

    R4.1. Everyone can toggle the dark mode
    R4.1.1. Only the admins can access the full crud
    R4.1.2. If a user logs in, the dak mode value will be loaded, and it can be saved for future uses
    R4.1.3. The users can change their own email and password, only knowing the old one
    R4.1.4. The users can also erase their own account if they need it
    R4.1.5. A screen will pop up to ask again if they are sure about erasing it
    R4.2. The users can write and send a message to the staff if they are logged in
  
R5. The app has a virtual reality, in which the users can view all what the app mainly supplies

    R5.1. Still everyone can toggle the dark mode
    R5.1.1. Everyone can watch the images and reviews
    R5.1.2. But only the users can write reviews
    R5.1.3. There will be some hot spots which the users can click and read some information
  
## Cases of use:

Like I said before, guests can watch reviews and images, but you need to be a logged in user to write reviews and messages. Only admins
can manage and watch all the tables.

### UML Model:

## Description of the operation of the system and technical specifications:

The frontend made in unity which you can run as a webpage, uses a nodejs backend to manage and connect to the sql database. 

Depending in the way you run the page you may need internet connection or not, In the way I show you will need it. Because it is
a web page which lets you upload and host your unity webgl build.

## Interfaces

### Design

#### Prototype:

### Usability:

After making the app now I will show some of the usability I added.

1-The app is so colorful, with the 3 colors that I repeat in the diferent pages of the project (yellow blue and orange) as
you can see:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81707462/146040605-7bb2b6b0-9794-402f-b9be-cc5c6026c1e5.png)

2-The options are intuitive, you can see the buttons clearly without overwhelming the most basic user, as you can see here, in the view with the most
available options, its easy to guess what you could find there.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81707462/146041341-91c27d95-9aea-416a-825e-65816342b3d3.png)

3-The guests are advised to make an account if they want to use the whole usage of the app, they are informed about it.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81707462/146042728-05d8cb82-9b87-4c66-a696-31325f9e4b9f.png)

4-When the user starts to register, they will receive advices of what they are doing wrong.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81707462/146048091-a37c777e-735c-47a7-8718-3ea82ec217f2.png)

5-The app shows that the user is logged in, by changing the log in button, and showing the username of the user connected.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81707462/146048601-535c6f11-3aa6-4888-a4a5-e6b309ef7efa.png)

6-Other time when he tries the log in again, he will be informed of the mistakes, included if the user and password don't match.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81707462/146052826-6a5ff422-2dfa-4cef-82a4-bef86bd2b6f9.png)

7-While logged in, the app gives some configuration to the user, by letting him change the email and password.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81707462/146050095-dbc3b9c2-e283-4cf7-99fa-c934212917c1.png)

8-Also deleting his account with a second chance to cancel it. Also for the admins when deleting data in the tables.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81707462/146050239-670ac7de-275b-4a6d-b536-9eb92b663878.png)

9-Guests can toggle the darkmode, but only users can save the prefered option, it loads automatically when logging in. This
changes are visible in all the pages.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81707462/146051202-ec2a1a06-b574-4a5c-b076-28945ad5ffe1.png)

10-The users can send a message to staff, with some advices to notice the errors, and when it's successfully sent.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81707462/146051705-349cfc2a-ed43-4f49-aeb2-2eacedaacd50.png)

11-The virtual reality has a comfortable menu, you can open and close it with just one key. Which is shown to the users, also
the hotspots and arrows to travel to other places have the right size and colors to be seen.

## Handbook

### Guide to install

#### Managing the Sql Database

After downloading the git repository, import the sql file to your sql manager. I use XAMPP to use the database.
(Remember, some programs need you to create a database with the same name it is on the file, in this case..)

    db_galdar_dev
XAMPP link: https://www.apachefriends.org/es/download.html
    
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81707462/146055064-ead5009b-997e-4e6e-b1ed-3c12d3f808e2.png)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81707462/146054941-02dc53d1-50ad-4f93-8800-8a1627d3e409.png)

#### Nodejs Backend

Now you have to run the backend, with visual studio code open the backend folder in the terminal and execute the following
code to get the necessary libraries (I don't upload them to make the file shorter). In order to do this you also need to install
node js.

visual studio code link: https://code.visualstudio.com/download  I use the version 1.63.0
node js link: https://nodejs.org/es/download/  I use the version 6.14.15

    npm install

And when you have everything ready run it.

    npm start

If for some reason you don't have the sql server at the default port 3306, you can change it in this file.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81707462/146056082-e2403dbe-8475-49ff-ab72-dd7f0cbb7f7d.png)

If all went right you should see something like this in the terminal.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81707462/146056321-1c8c212b-e2b8-42cf-b20d-200d3a7c846b.png)

And this page for example should load (don't try with users, it's protected)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81707462/146056451-06b8d96d-a137-407a-b44d-bc8f536cc5c1.png)

#### Unity frontend

In this point you have 2 choices, using the webpage already builded at this itch.io link. Or open the frontend folder in unity to try it with the editor.
With the first way you can easily see the final product, and with unity search for all the details. (webgl has a lots of bugs, some of
them like letters not appearing, I will try to fix it as far as I can)

My app at itch.io link: https://asoret.itch.io/advanced-reality

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81707462/146057242-d1afebe3-58ef-4af4-ac8a-364996646118.png)


With unity hub just click on the add option and select the folder, that's it

Unity link: https://unity.com/es/download   I use the version 2020.3.24f1 (with the hub you can install most versions)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81707462/146057173-34a65a87-d6c5-4a29-b02d-bb1d6510fd44.png)

To try it (with the less ammount of bugs) press the play button in the main page scene.
(You could build the project but it would be the same as using the link before, or build it like an exe app, would be
the same as trying it in the unity editor)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81707462/146057397-c9c2c210-8a20-4b84-8c08-4164b38592ad.png)


### User guide

Now a basic guide to use the app. (Even that most things are intuitive)

#### Main Menu

In the main menu you can do multiple things:

##### Log in / Register

Clicking the button log in, you can access to the log in and register form. This let you access to more options.
(The app helps you in filling the forms correctly, I could name all these messages but I already did it in the usability, check it there)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81707462/146058412-1bbd8a23-ce38-40eb-a213-811f58d21b97.png)

After logging in or resgistering, you can press the new button in the same place to log out.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81707462/146058658-8c8648c8-eaa0-4cb4-9a1f-be235fd69e13.png)

##### Info

You can see some info of the app, is drop and draggable just to try it.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81707462/146059003-6fbff959-4d6f-498d-ac9d-b2e700e8e166.png)

##### Contact

The form to send a message to the staff, only ussable if you are logged in.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81707462/146059248-f3f41841-3b4f-4125-b612-7e5c6fd8d11e.png)

##### Admin Settings

This button only shows up if the user is a admin. You can use the full crud of all the tables.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81707462/146059955-e17017fe-5062-460a-97f9-2623d8911988.png)

#### Virtual reality

The main purpose of the app, also has multiple options:

##### Map

The page where you land at the start, you can choose which place you want to see, this affects the other options.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81707462/146060748-cff35386-6678-4b7d-a124-bce2f8b10668.png)

##### Images

You can check some images of the place you chose on the map, it will be playa blanca by default.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81707462/146060956-62d20cb9-6fb4-4980-b6b0-13b88727593b.png)

##### Comments

Here you can watch the comments of other users or make your own if you are logged in.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81707462/146061072-6369f803-303e-4491-bafe-aa132bbe4c1b.png)

##### 360 place

And finally the most important place, and that I need to explain, you can move the camera holding the left click. But what
you maybe don't expect it's that you can zoom by holding the right click and moving it up and down. To reset the zoom press the
wheel button of the mouse. With Tab or clicking the small icon in the corner you can open the menu. The arrows and hotspots are self-exaplanatory.

## Technology stack

In this project I use unity version 2020.3.24f1, nodejs version 6.14.15 and XAMPP v3.3.0.

I chose nodejs to have this in common with most classmates, in case we needed help. XAMPP because im so used to it but I think
I will learn more about workbench as it seems more comfortable. Finally unity because it is great for 3d stuff.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81707462/146062154-a3dbc028-1a53-4362-b24d-78ca47059117.png)

## Technology comparison

At the start the company told us to use 3d vista, it's easier to make tours with it even without knowing how to script, but that wouldn't leave
us the chance to make lots of things with code and sql. So I decided to take unity at the end, I love how much you can do there in a easy way more
or less.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81707462/146062094-ba11c223-5e08-467f-a6da-695a4a264319.png)


## Repositories

I'm still new with github but this time I managed to use two branches, one for the develop of the app making tests and fixing mistakes, and the master one
where I have the read and I merget with develop at the end. I know I can improve more with this but I'm satisfied with all the commits I did.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81707462/146062444-1172a8a8-34d0-479b-b0c2-2d3c2670b06f.png)

## Planification

I didn't know anything about unity, but knew how to make the backend with nodejs. So the first day I finished the backend (but I made lot of changes to the table).
What the company wanted for the project it was a mistery, so I was a little lost, despite of that I'm grateful that I decided to start making a 2d crud to have one of
the most important things of the whole project (kinda the 60%). After weeks I finished the crud and the company gave us the idea to make a tour with a map, so it was time
to progress.

I finished the main page and was going to start the map to finally try the virtual reality but not really. The teacher remembered me that the app should be a webpage, and
when I tried it all the crud operations broke.. had to take some days to replace half the code but I could at the end, because unity webgl doesn't support http client, you
have to use unity web request. With some tutorials I learned a lot at the end and could finish the rest in a few days.

But the problem that got me the most lost time is rendering/building the project in webgl. Lots of things break or bug out, also my mistake because teamviewer lagged some things
making me think something was wrong with the app. I found a page that executes the build better itch.io, sadly there could be more errors like missing letters.

I planned to try the vr glasses in the app and addapting it, maybe try to let the user upload photos. But I ran out of time with the video in the main page. (not loading, lagging etc)

## Conclusions, opinions and reflexions

Finally i'm proud of the final product, I see how low expectations I had in the prototype (which is normal not knowing how to use unity) but I made a lot without help.
I admmit that some scripts like loginUsers has way to many text, I wanted to reduce it but it would take much time that I don't have right know, i'm sure that the next
one I will be more clean. And some graphics of the app look blur or not hd, fonts too bold, I don't like how webgl builds up, hope I make that better too.

Even that it was frustrating when things didn't work I really enjoyed learning unity, maybe we use it again in the real project and I will be ready. Teamwork is going to 
be the real challenge probably.
