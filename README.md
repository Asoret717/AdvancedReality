## Description:

In the future I have to make a virtual reality tour about Galdar's technologyc park, so I made this as a practise. This is for
the company ITC(Instituto tecnol√≥gico de canarias), and the interesting part its adding to the apps they make a crud with sql.

So the app will be a webpage which lets you watch some photos and 360 spaces of Lanzarote, with users that can register, login, make
comments, and send messages to the staff. With other pleasant extras like the dark mode and user configuration. I have no idea about
unity at the start of this project but the idea is learning to be ready for the next one.

## Database models:

The first table is used for the login and register, of the users, also for the admins with the attribute "isAdmin", because the admin
and the users can do things than the guests that doesn't log in. The user writes texts and reviews, so they are related, in the texts
we save the user email apart from the id to know where to answer if needed, and in the reviews we save the username to show it in the
reviews view, so other users can see it. Finally everyone can watch the images, they have an attribute called place to represent in which
360 image they are allowed to be seen.

### E/R Model:

To try the app use "npm install" if it's the first time, and "npm start" to run the backend. Don't forget the database.
Then open the frontend in unity or try it in this page https://asoret.itch.io/advanced-reality
